# Given a side of square. Find its perimeter and area.

#given:
side = 5 #side of the square 
#calculating perimeter and area 
perimeter = 4 * side 
area = side ** 2 

print("Perimeter of the square:", perimeter)
print("Area of the square", area)

# Given diameter of circle. Find its length.

import math
#given 
diameter = 10 #diameter of the circle 

#Calculating the circumference (length)
length = math.pi * diameter
print("Circumference of the circle:", length)

# Given two numbers a and b. Find their mean.
#given:
a = 8
b = 12

#calculating mean
mean = (a + b) / 2

print("Mean of a and b:", mean)

# Given two numbers a and b. Find their sum, product and square of each number.
#given
a = 7
b = 3

# Calculating sum, product and squares
sum_ab = a + b
product_ab = a * b
square_a = a ** 2
square_b = b ** 2

print("sum of a and b:", sum_ab)
print("product of a and b:", product_ab)
print("square of a:", square_a)
print("square of b:", square_b)
